# Time-Series-Forecasting-of-Sales
The objective of the project Forecasting System - Project Demand of Products at a Retail Outlet Based on Historical Data is to predict the demand for products at a retail outlet based on historical sales data. 
The goal is to create a forecasting model that can accurately predict future product demand, allowing the retail outlet to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, product sourcing, and sales planning. 
The project aims to improve the efficiency and profitability of the retail outlet by reducing the instances of stock shortages or overstocking. The project also provides a platform to analyze sales trends and make data-driven decisions to optimize the retail outlet's operations.
